# Cloud Security Projects

A series of cloud security and networking projects designed to demonstrate expertise in securing cloud environments. These projects focus on implementing secure infrastructure, managing access control with IAM, and ensuring data encryption.

## Project List:

1. **Secure VPC with Subnets and Security Groups**
   - Created a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS with public and private subnets.
   - Configured security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Implemented internet gateway for public subnet and private subnet for internal communication only.

2. **IAM with Role-Based Access Control**
   - Configured IAM roles and policies to enforce least privilege access.
   - Implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users.

3. **Cloud-Based File Storage with Encryption**
   - Set up secure cloud storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage) with encryption.
   - Implemented access control using IAM roles and bucket policies.

4. **Deploy a Cloud-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
   - Configured AWS GuardDuty (or Azure Security Center) to monitor cloud environments for suspicious activity.
   - Set up automated incident response using Lambda functions or Azure Logic Apps.

5. **Serverless Application Security**
   - Secured serverless applications using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
   - Implemented API Gateway security with rate limiting and CORS protection.

## Technologies Used:

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure
- **Security Services**: IAM, VPC, GuardDuty, Security Groups
- **Encryption Tools**: KMS (AWS Key Management Service)
- **Serverless Security**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions
